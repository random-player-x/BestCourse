Narayan made their presence felt, before Salman Rushdie, and more quietly, Amitav Ghosh and Vikram Seth, erupted into the scene in the 1980s, spawning a generation of writers attaining international acclaim - Arundhati Roy, Aravind Adiga, Kiran Desai, and many others. Some of the questions that will be addressed are: Who constitutes the main audience for this writing, and (how) does the writing cater to it? How does one position the expatriate Indian writer both residing and publishing abroad? How does English become an Indian language? Is there a thematic congruence in the novels that fall under this category, and does it differ from the thematic concerns of novels written in other Indian languages?

By means of close reading, analysis, and discussion, it will seek to identify the changes that take place during the process of adapting one art-form into another and ask why those modifications occur. An evaluation of what each art-form enables and what it restricts or denies will enable a better understanding of form per se, and of these two forms in particular. Further, the course will address the question of genre and its conventions especially with regard to film, and observe the extent to which generic expectations shape the process of adaptation of text into film. Film screenings will be held outside class hours in the evenings. # HUL335 Indian Theatre 3 Credits (3-0-0) Pre-requisite(s): Any Two courses from HUL2XX category Allocation Preferences: HUL231, HUL232, HUL235, HUL236, HUL237, HUL240, HUL239 This course will study the various aspects of Indian theatre.

It will contrast this heterogeneous category with other kinds of writing such as the \u2018functional\u2019 writing found in text-books and reportage. Through an analysis of various techniques of writing - in master-texts as well as students\u2019 own productions - the course will explore why and how literary texts continue to be a prime source of emotional and intellectual stimulation across cultures. As far as possible, the course will focus on contemporary writing, given that writers write in the \u2018here and now\u2019 even as they imagine the future or return to past memories. Selected readings will be used to focus students\u2019 attention on that most difficult of problems: to acquire a style of writing that makes a writer\u2019s \u2018voice\u2019 both unique and universal. Finally, students will be required to write in some genre(s) of their choice. These genres will include the classic areas of poetry, fiction and play-writing but will neither exclude non-fiction genres like the essay and biography nor forms of writing thrown up by the \u2018new media\u2019 such as blogs, photo-essays and narrative-writing for story-boards and video-games. # HUL338 Functions of Satire 3 Credits (3-0-0) Pre-requisite(s): Any Two courses from HUL2XX category Allocation Preferences: HUL231, HUL232, HUL235, HUL236, HUL237, HUL240, HUL239, HUL256 Satire is a classical genre that has thrived over the centuries in almost all languages and cultures, and is found in a range of media.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 679833, "end_char_idx": 684157, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a7922f9-58f6-4520-ab46-b1abd5a6e79c": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a7922f9-58f6-4520-ab46-b1abd5a6e79c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/utkarsh/Desktop/coursebot_backend/app/data/courses_of_study.md", "file_name": "courses_of_study.md", "file_size": 1663957, "creation_date": "2025-05-24", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a1a2414d-f576-43d4-ba18-3ca57e943cfd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/utkarsh/Desktop/coursebot_backend/app/data/courses_of_study.md", "file_name": "courses_of_study.md", "file_size": 1663957, "creation_date": "2025-05-24", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "hash": "be8a46c69fe38240d34980671cfd39ea0d4aa7038539882c285f738b82df3fac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "930545e4-7ac8-4995-ad97-9dce84c9ec3a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/utkarsh/Desktop/coursebot_backend/app/data/courses_of_study.md", "file_name": "courses_of_study.md", "file_size": 1663957, "creation_date": "2025-05-24", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "hash": "805f0e7fc31c6aa76d125c0363043465fb4c99f109a0103aead6fc2cb78031c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c2e1d3cb-7d2d-43b5-acb8-76fecf25599f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ea49fed452e497c975a285891e84296b480a2e91b3734dde7b6bf56e3435f978", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Finally, students will be required to write in some genre(s) of their choice.

Life, in all aspects, everyday provides grist to the mill of satire, but does satire change anything? How do we define satire? Why is it considered the social genre? What are the contemporary forms of satire? Who can practice satire? It draws upon diverse techniques such as allegory, irony, caricature and laughter.

Gender identities are not fixed or determined purely by physiology; their social construction affects ideas of masculinity and femininity or other sexual identities. Besides understanding how sex and gender are interrelated, we will look at how gender intertwines with societal areas of economy, technology, polity, religion and demography. The important role played by social structures and institutions such as caste, kinship, family, marriage, ethnicity, religion and class in structuring gender and vice-versa will be brought out. Technologies associated with population and biological sciences have transformed and are continuing to transform society and human relationships in particular directions. The course will examine these transformations at the global and local levels and consider their impact on individual lives. Challenges posed to intimate human relationships and identities by new reproductive technologies such as in-vitro fertilization, surrogacy, sex selection will be explored. What does the emergence/institutionalization of new social forms - such as same sex marriages and parenthood by surrogacy - tell us about the possibilities and limits of human relationships? # HUL378 Industry and Work Culture under Globalization 3 Credits (3-0-0) Pre-requisite(s): Any Two courses from HUL2XX category Allocation Preferences: HUL271, HUL272, HUL274 HUL275, HUL276, HUL286 Globalization and Globality; Classical theories to understanding work and industry; Understanding Work, Work Ethic and Work Culture; Post-industrial society and rise of informational economy; Job-satisfaction and alienation; Equalization of Opportunities and the Flattening of the World; Outsourcing as a Business Strategy; Important changes in industry and rise of IT sector and BPO industry; Governance and Collective Organization of Workers in select sectors; Corporate Social Responsibility. # HUL379 Sociological Perspectives on Organisations 3.0 credits (3-0-0) Pre-requisite(s): Any two courses in the HUL2XX or HUL3XX categories This course trains students to understand the social dynamics of different types of organisations, with a focus on practices of work and the making of workplaces.

Nor is it confined between 1780s and 1830s. Least is it a trend succeeded by Victorianism and realism, and assailed by modernism. Romanticism contends with the question of presentation \u2013 of representation of and to oneself. It therefore directly participates in the philosophical discussions of reason, sensibility, emotion, subjectivity, and most importantly the idea of human freedom. This course will familiarize students with romantic movements in arts, in theories of language and society, in post-Kantian philosophy, in attitudes to religion. Romantics not only engaged in experimental social practices and literary collaborations, but also articulated their necessity for the first time. Can we say that romanticism is at an end? How does it contribute to both a nationalism rooted in folk tradition, and individualism expressed in the cult of the hero, the solitary intellectual? How does it both look back to medieval occult and forward to novelties of science?

As language is learnt from infancy, we begin by introducing two approaches to learning: top-down and bottom-up. Further, we discuss language architectures that are both symbolic and non-symbolic in order to account for a fragment of English grammar: the past tense and nominalization. Following this, the course introduces some of the basic tools used by linguists in the analysis of language, while introducing concepts such as the syllable, morpheme, constituent structure etc. During lab sessions, students will work on problem sets to familiarize themselves with the analytical tools in linguistics.

Primary objective of this course is to introduce students with the process of economic growth and the long run sources of differences in economic performances across nations. Emphasis will be placed on developing theoretical tool kits in understanding growth mechanics. It is intended that this course will make students learn some of the workhorse models in modern macroeconomics, namely, Solow model, Neo-classical model, overlapping generations\u2019 model, models with technological change and technology adoption etc. # HUL741 Sociolinguistics: Language Variation, Culture and Society 3 Credits (3-0-0) Pre-requisite(s): HUL 234, HUL242 and HUL 350 for UG or Prior Permission of Coordinator This course aims at understanding variation mainly from a sociolinguistics perspective, but while also considering some relevant cues from generative views of the phenomenon. It will cover aspects of language change (bilingualism, multilingualism, language deaths, pidgin and creole formation etc.) as explained by feature-based and parameter-based grammars, as well by socio-cultural-political factors. The focus will then shift towards how homogenization of language also happens - combating the natural tendency towards variation - triggered by external factors. Concepts of race, gender, nation and identity will also be brought up to show the pervasive role of language in varied aspects of our socio-cultural-political lives. # HUL742 Transformational Theories of Language 3 Credits (3-0-0) Pre-requisite(s): HUL 234, HUL242 and HUL 350 for UG students and/or prior permission of the course coordinator This course will cover the fundamental concepts that have defined generative/transformational grammars since their inception in the 1950s. It will introduce students to the main motivations for such grammars for natural language, as stated in Chomsky (1957). A substantial part of the course will therefore be devoted to understanding the inadequacies of immediate constituent analysis and the need to include optional and obligatory transformational rules in the grammar. This will be followed by a detailed study of later theoretical developments, including those found in Standard Theory, Extended Standard Theory, Revised Extended Standard Theory and Government and Binding Theory. # HUL743 Language Acquisition, Teaching and Assessment 3 Credits (3-0-0) This is a literature review course that will explore the existing literature in the domains of Language Acquisition (both first and second), Language teaching (approaches and methods), as well as language assessment. In doing so, the course will include aspects of the philosophy of language, and the resultant application of these philosophical approaches in the form of classroom pedagogy. The course will also include substantial literature on \"action research\" where language teachers have written about the results of implementing various cognitive tasks in their classroom. # HUL745 Psycholinguistics 3 Credits (3-0-0) We will first introduce the relevant questions, theories, methodologies with regard to the historical trajectory of Psycholinguistics. We will then look at language processing at different linguistic dimensions. We will start with words, their meaning and access. We then look at processing sentences. The course will also cover important topics such as language and speech production. Reading processes (and its relation to processing) will be covered.

Phonological theory is thus composed on context-free and context-sensitive notions of markedness. While these are supposed to be universal, individual languages might vary significantly in prioritizing between these. The course therefore involves a major practical component where the speech units of individual languages (vowels, consonants and tones) are studied with respect to their phonological contexts. # HUL747 Language Computations and Mental Architecture 3 Credits (3-0-0) Pre-requisite(s): HSL521, HSL541 The course starts with a central tenet of language from the perspective of generative grammar, which is: recursion. We discuss the definition of recursion, differences between direct and indirect recursion, and its correlates to actual biological processes. We then move on to discuss if the same property defines other communicative systems, including those of non-human primates, insects and birds.\n---\n\\# Humanities and Social Sciences On studies conducted on tamarin monkeys, ants, bees and zebra finches, we try to answer if the structure of the human mind is different from non-human minds, and if so, how. Are computational processes any less or more complex in the two sets of minds under consideration here? Some overarching themes running through the course are: (i) how does the nature-nurture debate play out in human and non-human linguistic systems, (ii) which parameters result from maturational processes that are innately specified, and which parameters are acquired by learning, (iii) whether the mental space is carved into modular compartments, where each module is an adaptive specialization to a particular problem or whether a non-modular mind serves as a general-purpose learning mechanism, (iv) what are the determinants of errors and (v) the constraints on imitation and production of language constructs when placed in contact or non-ideal situations. # HUL748 Community psychology 3 Credits (2-1-0) Concept of community and their implications for community psychology. Community processes and orientations toward change. Examinations of the models; the mental health model; the organizational model; the social action model; the ecological model. Implications for a psychology of the community: the study of community life, interaction strategies; implications for manpower and training; family therapy and the community; crisis intervention; advocacy and community psychology. # HSL748 Natural Language Understanding 3 Credits (3-0-0) Pre-requisite(s): HSL522, or similar programming course, or instructor consent This course is designed as an introduction to the field of computational linguistics with a focus on linguistically motivated models of natural language understanding.

Emphasis will be given to the textual material and issues in reading and understanding. An overview of the following will be provided: The nature of the text, specificity of philosophical texts, text and context, issues in translation, interpretation and understanding. # HUL752 Philosophy of Social Sciences 3 Credits (3-0-0) Some of the key issues which arise in Social Sciences will be discussed in this course. These are: (1) What is \u2018out there\u2019 in the social universe? (2) What are the most fundamental properties of the social world? (3) What kind(s) of analysis of these properties is (are) possible and/or appropriate? (4) What are the natures of theory, law, and explanation? (5) Problems of reductionism. (6) Problems of free will versus determinism, purposeful behaviour, interpretations of actions. (7) Philosophical issues specific to various Social Sciences, e.g., philosophical bases of various economic theories, or of theories of psychology, or issues regarding the assumptions concerning human nature made by various social science disciplines. # HUL753 Philosophy of Science 3 Credits (3-0-0) The course will address three sorts of questions. The first set involves the status of science as a privileged source of knowledge: what, if anything, justifies this status? The second set involves concepts such as 'law', 'cause', and 'explanation' which occur within scientific practice: how are these to be understood? The third set involves understanding the relationship between different scientific enterprises: is there a hierarchy of sciences ranging from physics at one end to the human or social sciences at the other? If so, how should this hierarchy be understood? # HUL754 The Philosophy of Plato 3.0 Credits (3-0-0) This is a survey of Plato's thinking about politics, ethics, epistemology, and metaphysics. We will focus on a careful and critical reading of the primary texts, and attempt to get a sense both of their historical and cultural specificity, as well as their interest more generally as sources of philosophical insight. # HUL755 Fascism: Philosophical Perspectives 3 Credits (3-0-0) Fascism is one of the pernicious forms of power that emerged in the 19th and 20th century and posed a serious challenge to democratic forms of life. The course will discuss the philosophical understanding of power, state, law, sovereignty and freedom with the special focus on gaining a conceptual grasp on fascism. Some of the classical and contemporary philosophers who have directly or indirectly contributed towards constructing the intellectual edifice of fascism will be studied.

What role does it play in modern democratic societies? How does it influence the everyday life-world, belief system, and identity of an individual or a community? And, what are the relationships between the sacred and secular or religion and modernity? Addressing these questions, this course examines the various concepts, theories and debates in the sociology/anthropology of religion. Contrary to the predictions of the secularisation hypothesis, which envisaged the decline or privatisation of religion with the spread of modernity and techno-scientific rationality, it is observed that there is a religious resurgence or de-secularisation of the world. Religion has assumed a more public role. Given this, the course will examine the implications of religion\u2019s resurgence and active public role for modern democratic societies as well as the broader process of social order and social change. # HUL800 Research Writing 3 Credits (3-0-0) The course will include aspects of writing composition and stylistics that are essential to write a coherent research paper/abstract.

While the correlation between the meaning and sounds of a word are arbitrary, the string of sounds or phonological shape of words and other morphological units follow certain universal well-formedness principles. While many of these principles derive from the manner in which individual languages form rhythmic/ prosodic domains in speech, some make crucial reference to morphological notions such as homonymy and synonymy. The aim of the course is to impart certain theoretical tools to analyze words from any natural language data. Since the objective of the course is to learn to analyze natural language data, it involves a substantial practical component. # HUL843 Reading and Sentence processing 3 Credits (2-1-0) The course content will cover state-of-the-art models of reading.

It will respond to questions about the nature of the pre-revolutionary moment emergent within existing historical situations and yet departing from them; the designation of selective historical moments as revolutionary; the variety of domains beyond the narrowly defined domain of politics that have seen revolution, for instance, in science, technology, social relations, and philosophy. With respect to political revolutions, how is a revolution in history analysed, and what happens to sovereignty? What is the role of violence in revolution as compared to other categories of history (period, epoch), and how does it affect language itself, both of literary representations of revolution and of historiography? # HUL884 Environmental Ethics 3 Credits (3-0-0) Pre-requisite(s): HUL275. The course introduces different understandings about categories of \u2018environment\u2019 and \u2018environmentalism\u2019 that have emerged in contemporary thought, and its implications to its study in within an ethics framework. It seeks to explore three tropes. First, is a foray into the nature-culture debate, a debate central to environmental ethics. It seeks to lay the basis for the field by tracing key texts in the debate, viz., how the category of \u2018nature\u2019 is understood to be something which is external to humans. Second, we seek to understand the ways in which the \u2018crisis\u2019 in environment is constructed, a crisis which then would require certain ethical approaches to amelioration of our relationship with our surroundings. Third, is an exploration of specific themes in the field of contemporary environmental ethics - critical environmental aesthetics, applied ethics in agriculture, and explore ethical frameworks from non Western realms like in the Indic.\n---\n\\# Humanities and Social Sciences context, and Buddhist environmental ethics.

It goes on to investigate the contemporary postcolonial city in order to understand it in relation to late capitalism, globalization, migration, and postmodern culture, and the challenges these pose to classic modernity. It begins by providing an introduction to some of the most important literature on the city and the major theoretical debates around it, offering students a set of conceptual tools with which to approach the city\u2019s incommensurable realities, its problems and its potential. It moves on to a detailed analysis of a number of literary texts, examining some of the ways in which the disjunctive realities of city-life shape new modes of experience, creative expression, and solidarity, without losing sight of the inequities of gender, culture, class, and race that persist and indeed strengthen in the current global economic system. # HUp102 Research participation 1 Credit (0-0-1) This course will expose students to various experimental methodologies in sub-fields of Psychology and Psycho/Cognitive-linguistics.

The radiated noise characteristics from marine vessels and the unique characteristics of the acoustic signature with respect to the class of the marine platform will be presented. Recent research work has shown that classical homomorphic signal processing techniques and other channel inversion techniques can be used to significantly reduce the unwanted underwater channel distortions that otherwise affect the classifier performance drastically. The course shall provide insight into some of the methods that can improve sonar classification performance. |                     |\n| CRV742 Special Module in Radio Frequency Design and Technology-I
