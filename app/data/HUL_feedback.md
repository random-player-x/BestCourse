|No attendance criteria.Moodle based objective exam.|Participation is desired but not compulsory.|Turnitin based term paper and Moodle exam|Easy exam but grading is relative.| | | | |
|4/15/2021 13:57:46|HUL289|Ambuj Sagar|Usual grading (A at 80+ types). Tutorials interesting but decently demanding.|Readings for every lecture. Class participation is crucial.|Research paper format. Subjective only. Needs sincere dedication.|One of the best courses if the ambit of the course content interests you. Close to a nightmare, if it doesn't.| |
|4/15/2021 14:01:18|HUL261|Poornima, Varsha Singh|Very hard to score in tutorials as well as minor. Very tough to score a 10|Discussion based|Not at all lenient checking, no comments are provided about where the marks have been deducted.|Grading should be relatively easier. All the other HUL courses are scoring while this seems to bring my grade down.| |
|4/15/2021 14:07:45|HUL231|Divya Dwivedi and Angelie Multani|Relative. But A guaranteed over 80 marks. Marking strict. Course is little lengthy. Audited because of over-burdening before majors.|Reading required. Exerpts are usually 3-15 pages long. Some novellas also included which may be longer. Listen to class lecture and make notes: 10 is manageable.|Take home. Require Thinking and insightful. Usually from the lecture. Subjective only. Turnitin checking. Presentations may also be asked in a regular semester.| | |
|4/15/2021 14:22:04|HUL261|Varsha Singh|7|No, just recommended book is enough|Bad checking, more you write more you score|No attendence| |

|4/15/2021 14:54:07|HUL261|Purnima|very difficult to get 10|based from books, discussion based|moderate difficulty, write about 1.5X the word limit to get good score in assignment| | |
|4/15/2021 15:10:03|HUL261|Varsha Singh|mixture of relative and absolute grading, easy to score an 8|majorly based on the prescribed book reading|timed exams, strict checking, grading scheme isn’t well explained|confusing attendance police ; short attendance and plagiarism is a problem for sure| |
|4/15/2021 19:11:47|HUL242|Paroma Sanyal|A grade fixed at 80. Exams are moodle based, so easy to score. 9 is manageable, but if you are putting in efforts then you will surely get an A.|You will have to watch recordings and class material is a bit lengthy. Generally, there is no extra reading material apart from slides.|Moodle Based Objective Exam|No attendance policy.| |
|4/15/2021 19:23:26|HUL261|Purnima, Varsha Singh|Relative grading|Mostly based on the recommended book. Slides provided. Purnima mam told she doesn't ask from slides, but most of the subjective minor came directly from slides| | | |
|Mostly interesting content|Purnima mam: strictly no objective exams policy| | | | | | |
|- Paper reviews to be submitted, in which average marks are quite low. However, can score well with some effort and understanding| | | | | | | |
|- Subjective moodle-based one-hour exam in the minor. Very lengthy (require loooong answers), with again low average marks.| | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | | |
|Varsha mam:| | | | | | | |
|- objective quizzes on moodle instead of paper reviews, much easier to score| | | | | | | |
|- subjective major|earlier told that 80% attendance necessary else grade down, apparently was just a fluke, so no attendance policy| | | | | | |
|4/15/2021 19:51:23|HUL232|Milind Wakankar, Stuti Khanna|Wakankar sir is coordinator and he is not interested in this kind of conversations. Stuti khanna may do the relative grading if grading is in her hands.|Wakankar - Not in the CoS (Gita, Upnishad, and Rigveda), class discussion is important to be heard.| | | |
|Stuti Khanna - Short stories. Read beforehand and discuss in class.|Wakankar - Easy but need to focused in class.| | | | | | |
|Stuti -- Moderate.|No attendance. plagiarism can be caught easily because they ask for your thoughts about a certain literature. Wakankar sir's syllabus might be irritating as it is not what you'd expect from the course.| | | | | | |
|4/15/2021 21:17:45|HUL212|Saptarishi Mukherjee|Relative.|Recorded audio lectures and handwritten pdf|Moderate to tough. Minor and Quiz objective. Major objective and subjective both.|Highly mathematical and calculus based.| |
|4/15/2021 21:25:00|HUL239|Stuti Khanna|Teaches well, exams are easy-moderate. Didn't give 10 to anyone. 8 is super easy to get, 9 is not hard to get if you understand the material.|Read books and read the analysis on the Internet. Pay attention in class, she mentions a lot of keywords that she expects in your answers.|Easy| | |
|4/15/2021 21:27:59|HUL256|Sanil|If you copy, you will be fine. If you're ethical (like the class wants you to be), you're fucked.|Participation marks are there, but they're a joke. Participating sincerely will only give you 2 marks over the ones who never participate.|Weird and tricky|Avoid taking| |
|4/15/2021 21:33:56|HUL232|Milind Wakankar,Stuti Khanna|Easy to score 8-9|Attendance not required|Subjective papers on Moodle, just 1 question|Plagiarism checked but no action taken in quiz| |

|4/16/2021 13:05:13|HUL380|Farhana Ibrahim|Hasn't been made clear but absolute is assumed. Easy to score 10 if you attend classes. Minors and quizzes were scoring.|Need to speak up in class from time to time, 15 marks for class participation. Some is research papers, some is discussion based.|Depends on prof, current prof took easy minors, just 1 question as an essay type. Subjective papers. Plag is highly discouraged.|Attendance not strict but gives some benefits of attendance>90%| |

|4/18/2021 14:16:19|HUL242|Simona Sawhney|difficult exams; was happy with our batch to a lot of 10s and 9s although almost 30/100 withdrew. Previous batch grading was stricter. Absolute grading|A lot of readings, 3-4 per week about 10 pages each. Discussion based class with focus on class participation. Mostly about what you interpret about various stories and how it relates to a lot of issues like family, inter-personal relationships, caste, class etc.|Offline sem, difficult exams, but checking our year was chill.|Strict about attendance and grade down, would point and ask for class participation.| |
|4/18/2021 14:20:07|HUL289|Ambuj Sagar|Took in online sem, only term papers, people who spent time on it got a good grade but workload was a lot. A lot of components including tuts, class participation all of which took time.|Many long readings and 3 term papers. Discussion based class and tutorials. Had to read something from| | | |
|your own side for tutorials. Interesting if someone likes policy stuff, tho he is better offline.|Term papers only, time taking|strict with attendance, gives a lot of work online, but really interesting content.| | | | | |
|4/18/2021 14:21:53|HUL360|Arudra Burra|Absolute, based on subjective questions which could be answered if read readings.|Readings were nice on varied topics tho a but basic for someone who has done philosophy. Discussions weren’t as good online, could be better suited for offline.|Medium|Chill prof| |

|4/18/2021 19:42:48|HUL256|Sanil|relative, very chill grading, easy to score 9-10|A lot of discussions|Easy. sets short word limit(50-100 words) for answers so dont need to write too much. subjective| | |
|4/18/2021 22:33:37|hul212|sisir debnath|relative|microeconomics : lectures and tut are enough|easy mcqs| | |
|4/19/2021 0:31:07|HUL213|Jayan|Relative. Audited so not sure about grading. Probably not easy to score 10 as papers were easy and average was high|Class discussion + Notes. Content is repetitive and dull. Not really any mathematics in the economics. Focused on money, India's growth; etc. Term paper at the end + data assignment.|Easy MCQ Moodle based but so easy that everyone has similar marks. Term paper graded a bit more strictly; assignment was easy.|Lot of memorization, self reading of articles and reports outside of class to understand the subject properly. Course is actually not very useful.| |
|4/19/2021 0:37:34|HUL212|Saptarishi|Seemed absolute. Scoring minors/majors even though seemed like content was very difficult. Be very well versed with class examples as proofs/questions are often directly asked. 10 with regular effort.|Only based on class notes. Sir will write in detail, write down everything or get notes from a friend. Tutorials held regularly, TAs should provide answers.|Mathematical, proof based + numericals. Good difficulty, have to study to answer but if studied well then everything can be answered.|Great course for following exactly what the professor says to get a good grade. No term paper, no BS. Math background not necessart but helpful. Donuts after major!!! In offline sem.| |
|4/19/2021 0:44:03|HUL311|Debasis Mondal|Relative. Audited so not sure how the grading would be. Most high CGPA students of various batches are present so competitive. Exams are scoring + easy to cheat moodle numerical MCQs.|Based on the prescribed book. Questions similar to back exercises asked in paper. Several repeating themes in the book and the book explained these well.|Moderate difficulty. Some questions are easily found on google. If proof of work is provided within 5-10 minutes of end of exam; prof was willing to give marks even if wrong option was marked.|Mistakes accumulating over exams (3 quiz + minor + major) can bump down grade especially in online sem where it was way easier to cheat. Otherwise not really hard just tedious without giving scope for error (because of MCQ nature)| |
|4/19/2021 8:53:43|HUL242|Benu Pareek|80+ 10 easy|Boring|Easy| | |
|4/19/2021 12:20:47|HUL289|Ambuj Sagar|Took in online sem, only term papers, people who spent time on it got a good grade but workload was a lot.

|4/19/2021 16:46:08|HUL261|Purnima and Varsha (Coord: Varsha)|easy for an 8, mehnat for 9...10 not sure|Major and minor class discussion based...quizzes textbook based|Highly subjective checking| | |
|4/22/2021 21:14:22|HUL261B|Sumitava Mukharjee|relative. Tough competition. subjective exams.|Interesting at the end of course. Mostly boring.|Easy exams, subjective, moderate checking| | |
|5/21/2021 18:09:54|HUL371B|Ambuj Sagar|The evaluations were based on assignments, term paper, class discussion, class presentation and subjective assignment-type major. All of which were fairly challenging.|Purely discussion based. For a good grade, you have to attend classes, do all the readings and contribute in class discussions. But the material is very interesting and if you put in the efforts you will learn a lot.|Term paper is pretty challenging to write, assignments and major were moderate, but all require you to attend classes and do the readings.|Ambuj Sir's course was a fighter course. I would take it only if you're looking for a challenge and genuinely want to learn.| |
|10/14/2021 10:48:09|Hul271|Mahuya Bandyopadhyay|Absolute 9 without efforts|Easy to understand lectures and class discussions|Very easy mcq paper and easy project towards the end of the sem|Chill prof and chill grading| |
|10/14/2021 10:59:15|HUL253|Sanil|Papers seem to be graded arbitrarily because of lack of strict answers.|Need to participate in class discussions and tutorials. Need to write a research paper on a topic of choice related to morality and ethics.|Surprise quiz, need to be submitted as docx. Major weightage is to discussions and term paper.| | |
|10/14/2021 11:15:58|Hul212|Debasis Mondal|Relative, and easy to score|Mostly what sir teaches in class, which is usually out of the book or lecture notes|Easy|The prof is extremely chill. No attendance policy and the TAs are also chill and good.| |
|10/14/2021 15:03:24|HUL211|Ankush Agrawal|Relative, but 10 at 85+, so hard to get 10.|Teaches from slides(follows a book named gregory mankiw). Participation not compulsory.|Moodle based mcq. Moderate level exams. Have to do 2 assignments as well.|No attendance policy| |
